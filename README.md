# Your Purrfect Getaway
## 2.0
Your Purrfect Getaway is the AirBnB for your Purr Baby. Find a safe stay for your cat at any destination you are traveling to. These Getaways are strictly boarding for felines. There is no added stress of dogs barking or attention going to a multitude of animals. Each location can host your cat or cats in private and peaceful rooms. 

You can sign up to be a Host and provide the Purrfect Getaway for those searching to bring their Purr Baby with them during travel or who need someone to watch their baby while they are gone.
